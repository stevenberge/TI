ASHLEY: How could I help loving you? You have all the passion for  
  life that I lack. But that kind of love isn¡®t enough to make a successful  
  marriage for two people who are as different as we are. 
  SCARLETT: Why don¡®t you say it, you coward? You¡®re afraid to  
  marry me. You¡®d rather live with that silly little fool who can¡®t open  
  her mouth except to say "yes", "no",and raise a houseful of mealy- 
  mouthed brats just like her! ASHLEY: You mustn¡®t say things like  
  that about Melanie. SCARLETT: Who are you to tell me I mustn¡®t?  
  You led me on, you made me believe you wanted to marry me!  
  ASHLEY: Now Scarlett, be fair. I never at any time... SCARLETT:  
  You did, it¡®s true, you did! I¡®ll hate you till I die! I can¡®t think of  
  anything bad enough to call you... 

Mr.O'Hara: What difference does it make whom you marry? So long as he's a Southerner and thinks like you. And when I'm gone, I leave Tara to you. 

  Scarlett: I don't want Tare, plantations don't mean anything when... 

  Mr.O'Hara: Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'hara that Tara...that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land's the only thing in he world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts. 

  Scalett: Oh, Pa. You talk like an Irishman. 

  Mr.O'Hara: It's proud I am that I'm Irish, and don't you be forgetting, Missy, that you're half-Irish, too. And, to anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them...why, the land they live on is like their mother. Oh, but there, there. Now, you're just a child. It'll come to you, this love of the land. There's no getting away from it if you're Irish.
